# Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-practice
This repository contains the R code for a naive bayes machine learning model tested by making it distinguish between two proteins transcripts

The files contained in this repository are as follows:
 
 Naive_Bayes.r:  This file contains the r code used to differentiate between the nucleotide sequence belonging to the TNF transcript and the P53 transcript. Nucleotide data for both genes is obtained from NCBI and filtered to remove partial sequences. The model can be adjusted and the desired accuracy can be inputted by the user. The model will then loop and increase the length of oligonucleotides used to train until the validation accuracy is equal to or above the user inputted value
 
P53_fetch.fasta:  Fasta file generated by the r code containing the nucleotide sequences for the P53 gene from NCBI
  
TNF_fetch.fasta: Fasta file generated by the r code containing the nucleotide sequences for the TNF gene from NCBI
